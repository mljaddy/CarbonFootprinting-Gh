# CarbonFootprinting Ghana

This project seeks to create a database of embodied energy of building materials and operational energy of building typologies. This is key in establishing the carbon footprint of buildings in Ghana. The database is going to be run using an online platform. This will allow interested groups to submit key information needed for the computation of carbon footprint.  The aim of this project is to explore the scope and path towards establishing an open database and an inclusive community. 

Key goals of the Project
* Creating the metrics for the Online Database
* Developing a platform for Online community engagement
