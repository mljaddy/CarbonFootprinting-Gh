# CarbonFootprinting Ghana

This project seeks to create a database of embodied energy of building materials and operational energy of building typologies. This is key in establishing the carbon footprint of buildings in Ghana. The database is going to be run using an online platform. This will allow interested groups to submit key information needed for the computation of carbon footprint.  The aim of this project is to explore the scope and path towards establishing an open database and an inclusive community. 

Key goals of the Project
* Creating the metrics for the Online Database
* Developing a platform for Online community engagement


## The Problem 
The growing environmental impact of buildings and climate change has increased the drive for sustainable buildings. African urban residents are projected to grow from 11.2 percent in 2010 to 20.2 percent by the year 2050 (Saghir and Santoro, 2018). In the next 30 years, urban dwellers will outweigh rural residents for the first time in Africa (Awumbila, 2017). Meeting this demand requires the construction of buildings and annual investment in infrastructure. These construction works have considerable impact on the environment. Africa offers one of the greatest potentials for growth and subsequently change in the drive against CO2 emission and climate change (Hogarth et al., 2015). 
A plethora of studies have been conducted on finding ways of building more sustainable buildings (Ding and Ying, 2019). Most of these studies focus more on developed countries. Within the African subregion there is a dearth of studies in this regard (see Taffese and Abegaz, 2019; Ezema et al. 2015). In Ghana, carbon foot printing of buildings is at its nascent stage. This makes it difficult for the building sector to appreciate the extent at which materials selected and used in building construction affect the environment in relation with their carbon footprint. 

## Expected Outcome

At the end of this project, it is hoped that a path towards establishing an open database and an inclusive community will be charted.  Through this an enabling accessible portal that serves engaged groups and individuals will be formed. This will inure to the benefit of the local, national and international community.
