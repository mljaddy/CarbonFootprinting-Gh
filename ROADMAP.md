# Roadmap

Welcome to the Roadmap for CarbonFootprinting of Buildings in Ghana.

Please check the [README](https://github.com/mljaddy/CarbonFootprinting-Gh/blob/main/README.md) for an overview if you havent read it yet 

## What we need to do

The creation of the online database needs to be looked at in two major phases. Firstly, the database itself and secondly, the online community. 

### Creation of Data Metrics

In creating the online database there are two key questions that need to be answered;

> What data are we expecting to be supplied?

> What format should the data be available in and how should that data be supplied?

### Calculating Method for CarbonFoot Printing

There are a number of ways of calculating Carbon Footprinting. For this project it is important to decide;
>What methods or what is the best method should be used to compute the carbon foot print

>How should the results of these be displayed for easy usage


### Creating the Online Community

What is the best way to engage the key stakeholders to ensure;
> Data is supplied to the site
> Data is used on the site
